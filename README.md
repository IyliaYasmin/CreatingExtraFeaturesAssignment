(d) User Interface Design: 

* Two setting pages(Settings.jsp and SettingsProcess.jsp) and 4 CSS files(original.css, dark.css, light.css, pastel.css) are added. Settings.jsp page displays 4 options for users to click which are Dark, Light, Pastel and Original. Once user clicks on the button, the page will be directed to SettingsProcess.java page with a new theme that has been selected by the user.

* User interface for the system has been improved by referring to Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. For example, user control and freedom in Home.jsp where a reset button is added to support undo if users make mistakes in form. Then, aesthetic and minimalist design are implemented towards each theme with multiple colours with a consistent design that helps user to achieve their goals. Visibility of system status is also applied towards each button inside the system such as Submit and Settings button as they are animated with an arrow whenever cursor hovers it to show that the button is clickable to perform their specified actions. 

(e) Programming

* Added servlet to work on the server-side, jsp pages that support dynamic content, external CSS files to implement multiple design, MYSQL queries for database connection
